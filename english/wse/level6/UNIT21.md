Dear Helena,

I hope everything is good with you. I really like my job at the Healthy Juice Garden.  There is one problem. I work with a woman named Cindy, and she never cleans up the kitchen. I asked her three times, and she said she was too busy.  Last night, I didn’t clean up. This morning, she said, "The kitchen is very dirty today."  And I said, "I agree. We both have to clean up every night." She laughed and said, "You’re right. I am cleaning up right now!"

I am much happier at work now! Have a great day.

Your friend, Dmitri
