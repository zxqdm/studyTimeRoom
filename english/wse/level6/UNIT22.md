Dear Charlotte,

I hope you and your family are well. We are all good here, but I am very tired because of school and work.

I am taking five classes this semester. I have to take so many because I didn’t do chemistry last year. I must take chemistry if I want to finish school.

I also have to work. I started a job at a new restaurant last week. I really like it, but I have to close up three nights a week. I usually get home at midnight!

I also go to the gym a lot. Maybe I don’t have to go to the gym four times a week? I want to be healthy, but I also have to sleep! I usually visit my parents three times a month. Maybe I don’t have to do that so often? At the moment, I don’t know what to do! What do you think?

Love,
Rajika
